= Project: bigbluebutton

== Goal

Provide access to the BigBlueButton web conferencing API.

== Releases

=== Version 0.0.3
Fixes module issue preventing proper throwing of exceptions.

=== Version 0.0.1
This is the first version of this gem.  It provides an implementation of the
0.64 bbb API, with the following exceptions:

- Does not implement meeting token, and instead relies on meeting id as the
unique identifier for a meeting.
- Documentation suggests there is way to call join_meeting as API call
(instead of browser URL).  This call currently does not work as documented.
